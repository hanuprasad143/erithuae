    desc: "Manufacturers must constantly adapt to evolving operational and market demands as global competition, rising customer expectations, and supply chain disruptions reshape the industry. More than 60% of global manufacturers are accelerating digital transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiency, improve asset visibility, and enable faster, data-driven decision-making. However, many organizations continue to struggle with legacy systems, fragmented data, and manual processes that limit agility. At the same time, unplanned downtime remains one of the most costly challenges, with equipment failures and process inefficiencies costing the manufacturing sector nearly $50 billion annually. Aging machinery, reactive maintenance strategies, and lack of real-time monitoring often lead to unexpected outages, production delays, and missed delivery commitments. These disruptions not only impact revenue but also erode customer trust and increase operational risk. As a result, manufacturers are increasingly prioritizing predictive maintenance, automation, and connected technologies to reduce downtime, extend asset life, and optimize production performance. Leveraging real-time data, advanced analytics, and intelligent systems has become essential for improving reliability, lowering costs, and maintaining competitiveness in an increasingly digital and fast-paced manufacturing landscape.",
